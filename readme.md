All print statements are placed in individual functions inside
print_functions file, and all command functions are created
and moved to command_functions.py. 

Test functions for print_separation_line(), 
test_extract_msg_file_content(), and 
test_lock_depth_positive_check() and they all pass.

All modules and functions have docstrings.

type "python jlock.py -h" in the command line
to receive an explanation of all command arguments 
you can use and what they do.

C:> python jlock.py -lock 3 helloworl
